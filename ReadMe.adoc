= Project: Plant Analysis with Internet of Things

The goal of this IoT project is to develop a smart system that can monitor and analyze several environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, pH, and water temperature in real-time. This system will use an ESP32 microcontroller and an Arduino Cloud service to collect and store the data.


== Hardware Components:

ESP32 Development Board
Sensors for Temperature(DHT11), Humidity, pH, and Probe Sensor
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
Resistors and Capacitors (if needed)
Power Supply (USB cable or battery)



== Software Components:

Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
Arduino Cloud Platform
WiFi Network

Assemble the circuit following the diagram layout.png attached to the sketch

== Step 3: Load the code

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board

=== Folder structure

....
 sketch123                => Arduino sketch folder
  ├── sketch123.ino       => main Arduino file
  ├── schematics.png      => (optional) an image of the required schematics
  └── ReadMe.adoc         => this file
....

== Working Principle:
The ESP32 microcontroller will be connected to each of the sensors for temperature, humidity, pH, and water temperature. The ESP32 will read the data from each sensor and send it to the Arduino Cloud service using WiFi connectivity.

The Arduino Cloud service will store the data and display it on a dashboard, which can be accessed using a web browser or a mobile app. The dashboard will show the current values of each parameter and provide historical data over time.

Additionally, the system will send notifications to the user if the readings go outside of a predefined range, indicating that the environment needs attention. For example, if the pH level of water becomes too acidic, the system will notify the user to take action to correct the pH level.



== Conclusion 
This IoT project will help to monitor and analyze important environmental parameters in real-time, providing a valuable tool for agriculture, aquaculture, and other industries where precise control of environmental conditions is necessary. With the help of Arduino Cloud and ESP32 microcontroller, it is possible to collect, store and analyze environmental data at a low cost and with minimal setup.
